# Herkunft daten

Who is the manufacturer of the milk, cheese or sausage, for example? Was the cheaper product produced by the same manufacturer as a well-known brand product?

In order to identify the producer of products of animal origin, the EU has introduced the so-called health mark. It is an oval symbol that includes, among other things, the country of origin and the approval number of the manufacturing company.

I created an app that let's you quickly identify manufacturer by selecting the country and the approval number. Currently, the countries - Germany (DE), Austria (AT), Switzerland (CH), Italy (IT) and France (FR) are available in the app.

*__Just because a product comes from the same manufacturer does not mean it is the same product.__*

The python scripts here download the content and add them to a sqlite data base. Due to usage rights I did not include the files nor the data base.

Instructions are given as comment in the individual python files.
